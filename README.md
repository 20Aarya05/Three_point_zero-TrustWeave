## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Users provide information about:
   - Mobile usage patterns (SIM duration, recharge regularity)
   - Utility payment history (on-time payments, consistency)
   - Community involvement (group participation, reliability)
   - Financial capacity and assets

2. **AI Analysis**: Google Gemini AI analyzes the behavioral patterns to:
   - Identify responsibility indicators
   - Assess financial reliability
   - Generate trust band (T1-T5)
   - Provide reasoning for the assessment

3. **Trust Profile**: Users receive:
   - Trust Band rating (T1-T5)
   - Traditional credit score alignment
   - Detailed reasoning for the assessment
   - Actionable insights for improvement

## 🎯 Trust Band System

- **T1 (Exceptional)**: 750-850 equivalent - Highest trust, premium rates
- **T2 (Strong)**: 700-749 equivalent - High trust, competitive rates  
- **T3 (Developing)**: 650-699 equivalent - Moderate trust, standard rates
- **T4 (Building)**: 600-649 equivalent - Lower trust, higher rates
- **T5 (Emerging)**: 550-599 equivalent - Minimal trust, secured products
